1.  Introduction

   The QUIC version 1 protocol is a secure, reliable connection-oriented
   network transport described in [RFC9000].  Its features include
   integrated transport layer security, multiple independent streams
   over each connection, fast reconnecting, and advanced packet loss
   recovery and congestion avoidance mechanisms.

   Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (often shortened to
   "RPC") is a Remote Procedure Call protocol that runs over a variety
   of network transports [RFC5531].  RPC implementations so far use UDP
   [RFC0768], TCP [RFC0793], or RDMA [RFC8166].  This document specifies
   how to transport RPC messages over QUIC version 1.

1.1.  Motivation For a New RPC Transport

   Viewed at a moderate distance, RPC over QUIC provides a similar
   feature set as RPC over TCP with TLS (as described in [RFC9289]).
   However, a closer look reveals some essential benefits of using QUIC
   transports:

   *  Even though the QUIC protocol utilizes the same set of encryption
      algorithms as TLSv1.3, the QUIC record protocol encrypts nearly
      the entire transport layer header and authenticates each IP
      packet.  Advanced traffic analysis which was possible with TLS on
      TCP is no longer possible.  QUIC protects against transport packet
      spoofing and downgrade attacks better than TLS on TCP.

   *  Because many real IP networks are oversubscribed, packet loss due
      to momentary link or switch saturation continues to be likely even
      on well-maintained data center-quality network fabrics.

      The QUIC protocol utilizes packet loss recovery and congestion
      avoidance features that are lacking in TCP.  Because TCP protocol
      design has ossified, it is unlikely to gain these improvements.
      QUIC is more extensible than TCP, meaning future improvements in
      this area can be designed and deployed without application
      disruption.

   *  Further, because QUIC handles packet loss on a per-stream rather
      than a per-connection basis, spreading RPC traffic across multiple
      streams enables workloads to continue largely unperturbed while
      packet recovery proceeds.

   *  The QUIC protocol is designed to facilitate secure and automatic
      transit of firewalls.  Firewall transparency is a foundational
      feature of NFSv4 (which is built on RPC).

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  RPC-over-QUIC Framework

   RPC is first and foremost a message-passing protocol.  This section
   covers the implementaion details of exchanging RPC messages over
   QUICv1.  Readers should already be familiar with ONC RPC [RFC5531].

3.1.  Transport Layer Security

   RPC-over-QUIC provides peer authentication and encryption services
   using a framework based on Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Ergo,
   RPC-over-QUIC inherently fulfills many of the requirements of
   [RFC9289].  The details of QUIC's use of TLS are specified in
   [RFC9001].  In particular:

   *  With QUICv1, security at the transport layer is always enabled.
      Thus, there is no need or use for the STARTTLS mechanism described
      in Section 4 of [RFC9289].

   *  The discussion in [RFC9289] about the opportunistic use of TLS
      does not apply to RPC-over-QUIC.

   *  The peer authentication requirements in Section 5.2 of [RFC9289]
      do apply to RPC-over-QUIC.

   *  The PKIX Extended Key Usage values defined in [RFC9289] are also
      valid for use with RPC-over-QUIC.

   *  The ALPN defined in Section 8.2 of [RFC9289] is also used for RPC-
      over-QUIC.

3.2.  Establishing a Connection

   Two peers that wish to exchange RPC messages on a QUIC transport must
   first establish a QUIC connection.  As part of this process, the
   peers authenticate to each other.

   QUIC connections are not defined by the classic 5-tuple (IP proto,
   source address, source port, destination address, and destination
   port).  Rather, each connection is defined by its connection ID.
   Thus, if the IP address of either peer should change, or a NAT/PAT
   binding and the source UDP port changes, the receiver can still
   recognize an ingress QUIC packet to belong to an established
   connection.

   QUIC connections are largely opaque to RPC consumers.  This means
   that, due to network conditions or administrative actions, a QUIC
   connection can be replaced (a reconnect event) or migrated (a
   failover event) without altering the RPC messages flowing in the
   connection's streams.

3.3.  RPC Message Framing

   QUIC provides a "stream" abstraction, described in Section 2 of
   [RFC9000].  A QUIC connection carries one or more streams.  Either
   connection peer may create a stream.

   Unless explicitly specified, when RPC protocol specifications refer
   to a "connection", this applies to a QUIC stream.  As an example, an
   NFSv4.1 BIND_CONN_TO_SESSION operation [RFC8881] binds to a QUIC
   stream.

   When a connection peer creates a stream, that stream endpoint is
   considered to be an "RPC client" or "Requester".  That endpoint MUST
   send only RPC Call messages.  The other endpoint, known as an "RPC
   server" or "Responder", MUST send only RPC Reply messages on that
   stream.  Responders MUST send RPC Replies on the same stream on which
   they received the matching RPC Call.  Receivers MUST silently discard
   RPC messages whose direction field is incorrect.

   Each QUIC stream carries a sequence of one or more unsplit RPC
   messages.  Just as on TCP, each RPC message in a stream is demarked
   by a 32-bit record marker (see Section 11 of [RFC5531]).

3.4.  Stream Count

   Given the above definition of RPC message framing on QUIC streams, it
   is possible for a Requester to create a stream, send one RPC Call and
   receive one RPC Reply, then destroy the stream.  That is a degenerate
   case that might be used for simple protocols like rpcbind.

   For protocols that carry a significant workload, this style of stream
   allocation would generate needless overhead.  Instead, RPC clients
   may create as many streams as is convenient to their design, but
   reuse the streams efficiently.

   For example, an RPC client could allocate a handful of streams per
   CPU core to reduce contention for the streams and their associated
   data structures.  Or, an RPC client could create a set of streams
   whose count is the same as the number of slots in an NFSv4 session.

   Servers that implement RPC over QUIC must be mindful that each
   additional stream amounts to incremental overhead.  Servers can deny
   the creation of new streams if a client already has many active
   streams, and clients need to be prepared for this.

      |  bfields: Open question whether we should do something more
      |  complicated that adds RDMA-like features or at least provides
      |  some minimal help with data alignment.  Possibilities might
      |  include a single additional integer giving the offset of a
      |  payload, serving only as a hint; or reference additional
      |  streams in the same connection for payloads; or even looking
      |  into full RDMA--long-term there may be interest in supporting
      |  RDMA over QUIC, and we may be able to piggyback on that effort.
      |  
      |  cel: Direct data placement over TCP can already be accomplished
      |  today using MPA/DDP protocols (formerly known as iWARP).  Using
      |  a software iWARP implementation means no special hardware is
      |  necessary.  Likewise, if MPA/DDP can be made to support QUIC,
      |  much of the need for a separate RPC-over-QUIC is moot.  In
      |  addition, it would automatically bring transport layer security
      |  to other RDMA-enabled protocols (such as RPC-over-RDMA).
      |  
      |  lars: If changes to the RPC-over-QUIC binding might be desired
      |  in the future, how would they be negotiated/expressed?  Should
      |  a versioned ALPN be used instead of the one from [RFC9289]?

      |  NFS requirement on resends: QUIC allows reconnecting using the
      |  same connection ID, so isn't breaking/reconnection somewhat
      |  ambiguous?  When can a server drop or a client resend?  Any
      |  advice needed for server-side DRC implementations?
      |  
      |  lars: I'm not sure I understand what is meant by "reconnecting"
      |  above.  Is this referring to connection migration?  Or a 0-RTT
      |  repeated connection instance?  Something else?
      |  
      |  lars: Also, I'm not sure if the use of streams is fully
      |  specified by the above.  Is the intent here to leave it to
      |  callers to decide if they want to use a fresh stream for each
      |  RPC, or reuse an existing stream for a series of RPCs?
      |  
      |  cel: We need to define a server backpressure mechanism akin to
      |  the TCP window.
      |  
      |  cel: Should we limit each stream to carry only on RPC program
      |  and version combination?  Doing so would delegate
      |  demultiplexing of ingress RPC traffic to QUIC -- eg, NFSACL and
      |  NFS would be required to flow over separate streams.

4.  RPC Authentication Flavors

   Streams in a QUIC connection may use different RPC authentication
   flavors.  One stream might use RPC_AUTH_UNIX, while at the same time,
   another might use RPCSEC_GSS.

   GSS mutual (peer) authentication occurs only after a QUIC connection
   has been established.  It is a separate process, and is unchanged by
   the use of QUIC.  Additionally, authentication of RPCSEC_GSS users is
   unchanged by the use of QUIC.

   RPCSEC_GSS can optionally perform per-RPC integrity or
   confidentiality protection.  When operating within a QUIC connection,
   these GSS services become largely redundant.  An RPC implementation
   capable of concurrently using QUIC and RPCSEC_GSS MUST use Generic
   Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) channel
   binding, as defined in [RFC5056], to determine when an underlying
   transport already provides a sufficient degree of confidentiality.

   RPC-over-QUIC implementations MUST provide the "tls-exporter" channel
   binding type, as defined in [RFC9266].

5.  Implementation Status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.

   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   There are no known implementations of RPC-over-QUICv1 as described in
   this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   Readers should refer to the discussion of QUIC's transport layer
   security in Section 21 of [RFC9000].

7.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Editor: In the following subsections, please replace RFC-TBD with
   the RFC number assigned to this document.  Furthermore, please remove
   this Editor's Note before this document is published.

7.1.  Netids for RPC-over-QUIC

   Each new RPC transport is assigned one or more RPC "netid" strings.
   These strings are an rpcbind [RFC1833] string naming the underlying
   transport protocol, appropriate message framing, and the format of
   service addresses and ports, among other things.

   This document requests that IANA allocate the following "Netid"
   registry strings in the "ONC RPC Netid" registry, as defined in
   [RFC5665]:

         NC_QUIC    "quic"
         NC_QUIC6   "quic6"

   These netids MUST be used for any transport satisfying the
   requirements described in this document.  The "quic" netid is to be
   used when IPv4 addressing is employed by the underlying transport,
   and "quic6" for IPv6 addressing.  IANA should use this document (RFC-
   TBD) as the reference for the new entries.

      |  lars: Why one per IP address family?  This seems common
      |  practice with netids, but also seems to be a layering
      |  violation?
